# My Portfolio

> This is our first digital portfolio as software developers in Microverse.

Take a look at how it is going! https://ikuartz.github.io/Portfolio-queries/

Our objective is to create a website as similar as possible with this design
in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=34%3A848 .

I chose template 1 to mimic.

Below are some screenshots of the deployed website as it was on 17/01/22
