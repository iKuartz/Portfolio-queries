# My Portfolio

> This is our first digital portfolio as software developers in Microverse.

Our objective is to create a website as similar as possible with this design
in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=34%3A848 .

I chose template 1 to mimic.

Up until now the mobile version is pretty close to the target, although improvements would be possible given more time.
